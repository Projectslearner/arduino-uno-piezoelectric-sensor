# Arduino Uno Piezoelectric Sensor

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to interface a piezoelectric sensor with an Arduino Uno. The piezoelectric sensor converts mechanical stress (such as pressure or vibrations) into electrical signals. The Arduino reads these signals and outputs the sensor values to the Serial Monitor.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Uno**
- **Piezoelectric Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Piezoelectric Sensor to Arduino Uno:**
   - Connect the positive lead of the piezoelectric sensor to analog pin A0 on the Arduino Uno.
   - Connect the negative lead of the sensor to GND on the Arduino Uno.
   - Optionally, add a resistor (1MŒ© - 10MŒ©) between the positive lead and A0 for stability.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire up the piezoelectric sensor to the Arduino Uno according to the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Uno.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Observe the sensor values printed on the Serial Monitor as you apply pressure or vibrations to the piezoelectric sensor.

#### Applications

- **Vibration Detection:** Use in applications where detecting vibrations or impacts is necessary.
- **Pressure Sensing:** Implement in pressure-sensitive applications to measure force or touch.
- **Feedback Systems:** Integrate into systems requiring real-time feedback based on physical interactions.

#### Notes

- Ensure the piezoelectric sensor is securely connected to minimize signal noise and ensure accurate readings.
- Experiment with different resistor values to optimize sensitivity and stability of the sensor.
- Calibrate the sensor if necessary based on the specific application requirements.
